# West Lombard (Milanese dialect)

#### This project was conducted by students of the National Research University "Higher School of Economics".

## About the dataset
The dataset consists of Wikipedia articles in the Lombard language.

We started by obtaining the articles metadata via [PetScan](https://petscan.wmflabs.org/?psid=20645707) and sorting them by length in descending order, after which the first 200 texts were collected using Wikipedia API. Only articles labeled with both *"Articol in Milanes"* and *"Articol in ortografia milanesa"* were included in the dataset. We manually discarded articles that consisted primarily of mathematical formulas, descriptions of chimical elements, etc., and deleted titles and bibliographical references from the remaining texts. We ended up with a total of **54 texts, 4142 sentences, or about 135 000 tokens**, which were then automatically annotated with the [*italian-isdt* model](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Italian-ISDT) through the [web version of UDPipe 2.6](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/run.php). Before proceeding with the annotation, unique ids were added to the sentences; the ids contain information about the language, dialect, and source of the text, as well as the number of text and the number of sentence in our dataset (i.e. *lmo-mil-wiki-doc2-s451*).

The first 1 650 sentences were evenly distributed between 11 annotators, and each annotator chose at least 50 out of 150 sentences to carefully check and correct the automatic annotation, thus creating annotations for the Lombard sentences in a semi-automated manner. **The total number of sentences with manually corrected annotations is 576**, divided into 11 files. The sentences are not necessarily in order.
